# Web-dev-helper

## Author: Daniel Benedict L. Omoto
## Description: Helper tool for front-end web developers. 

### Goal of this library:
* Skips the process of learning the syntax and workflow, and makes the focus of the developer on the design rather than the code.
* Less typing, more on cliking concept. Much like Visual Basic but less code. 
* Mainly used on HTML and CSS.

### Main Features that must be developed:
* must be highly customizable
* able to load the files from the localhost, ability to save it and overwrite, and
* variety of input methods, i.e. sliders, number input, range, steps, etc.
* add helper via script, the helper must be viewable after reload.
* uses iframe to have a live preview of the changes the developer makes.

### TOOLS TO BE DEVELOPED
* Inspector Tool - upon clicking on an element, it shows on the helper the ID and CLASSES that elements has. If more than 1 element is present on that click location, it will cycle through from top to bottom.
